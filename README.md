Now let's dive a little bit in the explaination, in this project i used The MERN ( Mongo Express ReactJs NodeJs ) to build a Web application wich responds to the requirments listed in this link bellow :
https://github.com/hiddenfounders/web-coding-challenge/blob/master/coding-challenge.md


the project consists of two folders One for the server side scripts, and the seconde for the Client side scripts. besides some Envirenments Variables which must be declared first of all :

SECRETORKEY="Your Secret Or Key "               [STRING]  // required by JWT      Library

# BackEnd Folder
in this folders resides the server side dependencies, So make sure you have NODEJS and NPM installed first, then open your Commande Line :

1 - git clone https://github.com/OussamaKasraoui/MERN-SHOPS.git
2 - cd MERN-SHOPS/BackEnd
3 - npm install       // to install application's dependencies ( Only for the first Time )
4 - node app.js       


# frontend Folder
in this folders resides the server side dependencies, I suppose you had already cloned the project, so in your Commande Line make sure you are in MERN-SHOPS directory then:
